This notebook demonstrates a complete computer vision pipeline for analyzing football (soccer) videos. The goal is to take a video clip of a goal from YouTube, automatically detect and track the players using the YOLOv8 model, identify the key player's path, and generate a dynamic "dot-and-trail" animation that visualizes their movement. This project showcases how to handle real-world challenges like fragmented tracking and provides a framework for creating data-driven tactical visualizations from raw video footage.
